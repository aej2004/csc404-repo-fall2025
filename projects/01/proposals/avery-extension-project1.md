# Task

<p>This project had us look into the features that we think are missing from the Lox programming language and find out how we could implement it into the program to 
make the program more useful. Once we found something that we found interesting to have, we then were tasked with researching more into the topic and creating a 
proposal for why our feature should be an addition to the Lox programming language.</p>

# Motivation 

<p>When I looked into the Lox programming language, I found that I was missing the <b>exception handling mechanism</b> that we use to help catch errors 
and prevent runtime errors that we can often run into. This is something that I've found helpful when trying to debug programs in the past especially in classes 
where the runtime of a program was a major part of the concepts being taught.</p>

<p>For example, when running the following code:</p>

``` "hello" / 2; ```

<p>there would be a runtime mismatch error in Lox due to the attempt of an operation of different variable types. This within a bigger block of code could be hard to 
spot and could be have easily been fixable with the use of a try-catch implementation. With another example:</p>

``` 
function recursion(x) {
  print x;
  recursion(x+1);
}

recursion(x);
```

<p>there would be a stack overflow error because the function as it stands right now has no end and will go until the computer has no memory left to store all the data 
being used to run the program. If the programming language had a try-catch we could test the different parts of the function to see what runtime error was occuring
and have it output a message that tells exactly what problem we are having and where.</p>

# Rational

One way that I could see these exception handling mechanisms being implemented into the Lox language is 

# Specification of Syntax and Semantics

# Examples
