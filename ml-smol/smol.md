# SMoL (Standard Model of Languages)

[smol-tutor.xyz/tutor/](http://smol-tutor.xyz/tutor/)

This series of tutorials revolve around a central idea, **SMoL**, the **S**tandard **Model** **o**f **L**anguages. This is the embodiment of the computational core of many of our widely-used programming languages, from C# and Java to JavaScript, and Python to Scala and Racket. All these languages (and many others), to a large extent, have a common computational core:

- lexical scope
- nested scope
- eager evaluation
- sequential evaluation (per ‚Äúthread‚Äù)
- mutable first-order variables
- mutable first-class structures (objects, vectors, etc.)
- higher-order functions that close over bindings
- automated memory management (e.g., garbage collection)

Over the course of the SMoL Tutor, you will become familiar with these language features through reading and evaluating programs. 

In general, it‚Äôs not hard to "cheat" on these tasks; we haven‚Äôt tried to make it difficult to do so. But if you do, you may find some things that we discuss later in the course very difficult to understand. So please work wisely.

You should work through the material at your own pace, on your own (not with someone else).

# Time

Each module should take 10-20, and at most 30, minutes.

# Expectations

The Tutor automatically tells you about the correctness of your work.

You are not expected to answer all questions correctly. Indeed, it would be virtually impossible for you to do so: we‚Äôd be surprised if anyone got everything right. Counting how many things you get right will make you shift focus to scores rather than on understanding, so we will not do so.

Instead, we only care that you (a) do all the tutorials and (b) put in a good-faith effort on each one. Trying to get help (from other people or AI tools or whatever) may help you "do better" or go quicker now, but you will find some later parts of the course virtually impossible to understand. So please don‚Äôt do that.

# Software

*Note:* The Tutor is new software. Currently, it does not have the ability to save state. That means you should finish every module you start; you *can‚Äôt* pause a module and resume it later. (You can, of course, take a break *between* modules.) Most modules are broken into multiple pieces to make it easier to take a break.

The Tutor shows you programs in multiple languages, to reinforce that the concepts you are learning are standard across languages. The language on the left, which is pseudocode, is fixed; the one on the right varies randomly. You can change the random choice by using the üé≤ button. We recommend that you frequently roll the üé≤ to explore different syntaxes.

# Submission

At the end of each module, you will be provided a button to download a PDF version of the completed module script. Please download each PDF and upload it to Canvas. We recommend you also hold on to the PDFs for review/reference.

There is no presentation aspect to this activity.
